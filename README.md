# Euclidean and Manhattan Distance Calculations
_____
In this short mini project you will see examples and comparisons of distance measures. Specifically, you'll visually compare the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan distance measures. The application of distance measures has a multitude of uses in data science and is the foundation of many algorithms you'll be using such as Prinical Components Analysis.
